  <h1>TripSplit.io Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices at Ka-tet Development LLC., TripSplit.io, including the website located at https://www.tripsplit.io/, the Ka-tet Development LLC and TripSplit.io mobile applications, and the related services, applications, and websites owned or operated by us (collectively, the "Service").</p>

  <h4>What Information We Collect</h4>

  <p>The types of information that we collect fall under two general categories: personally identifiable information (PII) and non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). PII consists of any information which can be used to specifically identify you as an individual, whereas non-PII consists of aggregate information or any other information that does not reveal your identity. This Privacy Policy describes how your PII and non-PII are collected by us, and how we use such information. Please note that we store all information we collect, including PII and non-PII, on servers located in the United States. When you use the Service, you consent to that.</p>

  <h4>Log Files</h4>

  <p>Any time you access the Service, our servers automatically gather information from your browser or device, including some PII and some non-PII. This information includes your IP addresses and browser type (if you are using a browser), device ID, location (if you have enabled this feature), Internet service provider (ISP) or wireless service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We may use this information to analyze trends, administer and improve the Service, prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not share this information externally.</p>

  <h4>Cookies</h4>

  <p>We use "cookies" to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting our website or using the Service. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to our website and distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors. They also allow us to save user preferences and track user trends. We rely on cookies for the proper operation of our Service. If your browser rejects cookies from the Service, then the Service will not function properly with your browser, and we are not responsible for any resulting loss of functionality in the Service.</p>

  <h4>Service Analytics</h4>

  <p>We use third-party analytics service providers (“Analytics Providers”), such as Google to help us analyze how users use the Service. We may change the Analytics Providers that we use from time to time. The information generated by your browser or device about your use of the Service will be transmitted to and stored by the Analytics Provider(s) on servers in the United States. The Analytics Providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating users use the Service, compiling reports on website or mobile activity for our use and providing other services relating to Service activity and Internet usage. The Analytics Providers may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on the Analytics Providers’ behalf. By using the Service, you consent to the processing of data about you by the Analytics Provider in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>

  <!--<h4>Location Information</h4>

  <p>If you enable location-based services by the Service and your mobile device, the Service may collect data about your geographic location. Such location data may include, for example, geographic coordinates or other data used to determine your location (using GPS, IP address, Wi-Fi, or other technology to determine the location of your device), the time when such data is collected, and a non-PII identifier that we may use to correlate such data to you (collectively, the “Location Data”). The Location Data may be collected, stored, and processed by us and/or by our third-party location licensors or service providers. We may use the Location Data to analyze usage of the Service, to improve the Service, and to provide the Service to you (e.g., by providing you with location-based recommendations of places we think you might want to visit through the Service when you are exploring a new city).</p><p>For example, if you visit Hotel XYZ in San Francisco, the Service and/or one of our third-party service providers may collect the location visited, the time of your visit, and a non-PII code that is unique to you. The Service could then use this information to push notifications to you relevant to that visit (e.g., recommendations of the most popular dinner places near Hotel XYZ or interesting events happening near the hotel).</p>

  <h4>However, it is important to note that:</h4>

  <p></p><ul><li>(a) We will not share Location Data with anyone other than our licensors or service providers who provide the location services for the Service.</li><li>(b) If any such third-party licensor or service provider collects, stores, or processes any Location Data for the Service, we contractually require that they not use the Location Data for their own purposes (other than analyzing and improving their location products and services) or share this data with anyone but us (other than aggregated, anonymized data that does not identify any individuals).</li><li>(c) You may enable or disable location services at any time using the settings in the app and/or your device’s operating system.</li></ul><p></p>

  <p>When you register for the Service, we collect a variety of information about you to complete your online profile. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose your PII to other users of the Service.</p>

<!--
  <h4> E-mail</h4>

  <p>We require an email address from you when you register for the Service. We use your email both for transactional purposes (e.g., activity updates such as notices that another user has invited you on the Service) and for promotional purposes (e.g., newsletters, new product offerings, event notifications, special third-party offers). Email messages we send you may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the emails, including whether the email was opened and what links (if any) were clicked. If you would rather not receive promotional emails from us, please see the section below labeled "Choice/Opt-Out".

  <h4>Demographic Data</h4>

  <p>	Demographic data is also collected by the Service. We use this data to tailor our visitors' experience, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. Some of this information may be shared with advertisers on a non-personally identifiable basis.</p>

  <h4>Disclosure of Your Information to Third Parties</h4>

  <p>Disclosure Authorized or Required By Law. You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if:</p><ul><li>(a) we believe in good faith that we are authorized or required to do so by law, including to respond to requests or orders relating to law enforcement, national security, or any legal process; or</li><li>(b) you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information; or</li><li>(c) we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect or defend the rights or property of us or a third party or to protect someone's health or safety.</li></ul><p></p>

  <h4>Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties By Us.  </h4>

  <p>We will only share your information with third parties in the ways defined in this Privacy Policy. We may share your non-PII with third parties, but not in a manner that would reveal your identity. For example, when you access a page on our website, a cookie may be automatically set by us or by our service providers to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.</p><p>We may share your PII, sometimes in conjunction with your non-PII, with service providers that may be associated with us to perform functions on our behalf. For example, outsourced customer support agents or technology infrastructure providers (such as a provider of location services, as described above) may need access to your information to perform services for you. We require that your information be treated as private and confidential by such service providers and not be used for any other purpose than we authorize.</p><p>Information Transferred As a Result of Sale of Business. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your PII may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. If this occurs, you will be notified if there are any material changes to the way your PII is collected or used.</p>

  <h4>Third-Party Advertising</h4>

  <p>We may use third-party advertising agencies o other service providers to serve ads on the Service on our behalf or on behalf of third-party advertisers (e.g., retailers of goods or services). These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons in ads on the Service is completely anonymous. However, if you click on a link to a third-party website or service, then the third party’s website or service would be subject to that third party’s privacy policy and terms of use.  Some of these third-party advertising agencies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers you the option to opt out of ad targeting from its member agencies by following the procedures listed at Networkadvertising.org.</p>
